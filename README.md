## 🚀 Overview

**NextRead** is an interactive web application built with **Gradio** and **LangChain**. It enables users to:

* Understand **natural language** book queries using LLMs.
* Retrieve relevant books through **semantic search** with MiniLM embeddings.
* Classify books as **Fiction** or **Non-Fiction** using **zero-shot learning**.
* Filter suggestions based on **emotional tone** like joy, sadness, or fear.
* Explore books via a **responsive UI** featuring animated, scrollable carousels.

## ✨ Features

### 🔍 Smart Semantic Search

Search using everyday language. Forget keywords—NextRead uses embeddings and cosine similarity to retrieve books that **match your intent**, not just your words.

> *Try: “heartwarming travel memoir with humor” or “dark, fast-paced thriller”.*

### 🏷️ Fiction vs. Non-Fiction Classification

Uses the `bart-large-mnli` model to instantly classify and filter books by type — **no pre-labeling needed**.

### 🎭 Emotion-Based Filtering

Detects the dominant **emotions** in each book description (joy, sadness, anger, etc.), helping you choose books that **match or shift your mood**.

### 🎨 Clean & Responsive Frontend

Built with **Gradio Blocks**, the UI is modular and mobile-friendly with interactive components like:

* Featured book **carousel**
* **Hover effects** for rich previews
* Clean layout optimized for engagement
